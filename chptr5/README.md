chapter 5


In this chapter, git stresses out the addvantages of distributed version control systems and a flexible way for user to collaborate on projects as oposed to centralized version conrol methods with restricts users since most of the work is done in only one place (though many of the concepts behind git are based on CVCSs). With distributed version control, user can contribute both to thier repositories and other repositories they contribute code to. This advantages broadens workflow posibility and streamline project development felxibility.

Integration between repositories are build into a very flexible structure that one developer can work on thier own while having read access to another and write access to another.

In an integration manager model, all of these activities are monitored by the maintainer of the repository whom has the ability to accept submission from others and granted read to others. They also have the ability to add other people as maintainers of the repository or transfer permission from him to another person. Thoush everyone should be responsible for making sure there aren't any trouble caused by anyone changing something over a repository which is the main responsibiltu of the maintainer.

Another workflow dynamic is the dictator lautenant model, which the user push their changes back to the original owner and the owner to the repository. This is mainly used in very huge project where there are a large amount of colaborators working in the project. Each leautenant has devs that push repos changes to them and the leutenants push the changes to the dictator. This provides a more strict and streamlined workflow over project since only one person has the refence the repository.

Git also talks about project contribution and how one can properly contribute to a project with any troule by following specific guidelines by git and the maintainer of the repository and how to properly set up commits. The section also discusses about workflow models for specific teams to be used (if the project is private, managed or public).

In the last section, git discusses about proper project management, giving importance on proper branch management, patches and integrating branches from contributors. The sections also teachers how to properly monitor the project by giving them ways on what to introduce inside the project and how to orient contributors on the things that needs to be done in order to streamline project workflows.
