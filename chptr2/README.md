chapter 2


The first sections of the chapter tells about initializing up a local repository and setting up the necessary commands for the initialization either on an existing derectory or a cloned repository. The first ections also talks about keeping track of status of files inside the local repository using the "git status" command (the command can also be used to view staging status) and adding or removing files for staging. It also talks about the necessity of ignoring some files if the user doesn;t necessarilly need to add files groups via .gitignore where the user can specifiy contrainsts on what files should be ignored by git by putting in file descriptors (names, extensions, etc.). Aside from traking the files in staging, the user is also given the option to know the differences between the staged and the not yet staged files. Once staging is done a commit can be made for the staged files.

The next sections explains how the user can view commit history to view records of all commits ever made and how can these ba helpful in keeping tracks of what the user did (or what everyone did) or the changes made during the course of the project development. If some actually goes wrong, the next sections explains how to undo things, from undoing a staging, removing a file from staging, to undoing a commit (which in the real world, i don't recommend doing)

The final sections of the chapter explain how these commits can be reflected back online by pushing the changes made to the repository and other helpful commands the a user might need to have more control of what he/she is doing. They also discussed about the basics of tagging ffor labeling versions and giving some commands aliases for command entry to be more convenient and natural (this is actually user dependent, and it is always better to type the whole command so you really would know what you're doing)
